Stable Sort
----------
	a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if :
	Two objects with equal key appear in the same order in "Sorted Output" as they appear in "Input"
		example:
			I/P:
				peach    
				straw <---
				apple	  |
				spork <---
			O/P:
				apple
				peach
				straw <---
				spork <---
				
	-  Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like { Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc }
	and some sorting algorithms are note like { Heap-Sort, Quick-Sort, etc }


	Sorting algorithms are :
		[1]Internal
			1)Insertion
				1-insertion
				2-Shell
			2)Selection
				1-selection
				2-Heap
			3)Exchange
				1-Bubble
				2-Quick
		[2]External (Merge)
				1-Natural
				2-Balanced
